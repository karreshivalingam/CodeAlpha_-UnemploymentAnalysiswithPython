# Unemployment Analysis with Python — CodeAlpha Task 2

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze unemployment rate data to understand trends, seasonal patterns, and the impact of Covid-19. The analysis aims to extract insights that could help inform economic and social policies.

## Dataset
- Dataset: Unemployment in India
- Records: 740
- Key attributes include region, date, unemployment rate, employment count, labour participation rate, and area (urban/rural).

## Project Workflow
1. Loaded and verified the raw unemployment dataset
2. Cleaned column names and converted date fields
3. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Analyzed overall unemployment trends over time
5. Studied the impact of Covid-19 on unemployment
6. Identified seasonal (month-wise) patterns
7. Compared unemployment across regions and areas

## Key Insights & Policy Implications
- Unemployment increased significantly during the Covid-19 period compared to pre-Covid levels.
- Urban areas showed higher unemployment (~13.2%) than rural areas (~10.3%), indicating greater job loss in urban sectors.
- Seasonal trends reveal unemployment peaks during April–May.
- Regions such as Tripura, Haryana, and Jharkhand show consistently higher unemployment rates.
- These findings suggest the need for region-specific and urban-focused employment policies, especially during economic disruptions.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analysis using Python can uncover meaningful patterns in unemployment data and help understand the socio-economic impact of large-scale events like Covid-19.
